    I am humbly bow to my <b>SADGURU SRI GNANANANDA GIRI</b> . There is no record where he made avatar in this earth . There is no record when he made avatar. There is no record to know what is the age of my guru . He is beyond time . He was the Chief Disciple of the Sri Sivaratna Giri Swamigal and one of the leaders (Peetathipathis) of the Jyotir Math, one of the four Maths established by Adi Sankara. This lineage of Peetathipathis is also called the 'Giri' Paramparai, as seen from the Peetathipathis' name which ends with 'Giri'. Gnanananda is a Mahayogi, Siddha Purusha, Himalayan sage and Indian philosopher. He believed in Advaita Vedanta because of his lineage. He had a number of disciples including Vidyananda, Triveni and Dasagiri.Sivaratna Giri Swami accepted Subramanyan as his disciple and named him Pragnana Brahmachari. Sivaratna Giri initiated Gnanananda in the traditional manner into the Giri order of Jyotir Mutt and gave him the monastic name of Sri Gnanananda Giri. Sivaratna Gnanananda adorned the 6th lineage of Peetam of Jagadguru Totakacharya for some time. However, he nominated one Ananda Giri in his place and retired to the height of the Himalayas for penance. Gnananda spent many years at the sacred spot of Gangotri and icy caves of the Himalayas in intense tapas. He travelled extensively on foot, spanning the whole India and Tibet, Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Malaya. He met many holy men over the course of his pilgrimage . I dont have no more words to tell about him . I trying to do only a small guru bhakthi to his lotus feet.<a href="http://gnanananda.org/gnanananda/">Detail link to know more about my guru.</td></table> </a> </p>
